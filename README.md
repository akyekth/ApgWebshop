Its look like online store.buying and selling items.


Acme Plastic Gnomes are selling more and more gnomes each day and the CEO, Mr. S. Anta, has finally decided that the time is ripe for Acme Plastic Gnomes to enter cyberspace! The first attempts of devicing an electronic commerce infra-structure using pigeons and straw were complete failures. The task are now in your hands. You will have to implement and deploy a working webshop in Java. You implement the webshop as a Web-application using the Java EE technologies, e.g JSF, servlets, EJBs, and JPA (or JDBC), to be deployed and run on an application server, e.g. GlassFish.
Use of Java EE technologies, e.g., JSFs, servlets, JPA and EJBs, in this project is graded as an optional extra work for higher exam bonus. This project is broken down into following three sub-assignments (sub-systems).
